# Getting Started

To start developing with Opkit, you must first be an Opkit customer! Learn more and schedule a demo [here](https://www.opkit.co/).

After becoming an Opkit customer, you should consider which integration mode is appropriate for your use-case. Read [API vs. Webhooks](/docs//API_VS_WEBHOOKS.md).
