# OpenAPI 3 specification for the Opkit public API

To generate TypeScript types from this schema, run the following command:

```bash
npx openapi-typescript oas3.yaml --output index.d.ts
```

When making changes to oas3.yaml or oas3.json, make sure to copy these changes to the other file!

Please edit YAML first and copy the changes to JSON, as opposed to the other way around. This allows us to use comments in the YAML!
