# Opkit OpenAPI Spec

This is the [OpenAPI 3 specification](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html) for the Opkit public API.

## Generating TypeScript Types

To generate TypeScript types from this schema, use oas-tools from the Opkit monorepo!

## Contributing

When making changes to oas3.yaml or oas3.json, make sure to copy these changes to the other file!

Please edit YAML first and copy the changes to JSON, as opposed to the other way around. This allows us to use comments in the YAML!
